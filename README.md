## Assigned Flutter Task Description
*

Q1:
Please answer the following: 

*How did you approach the task?*

Tried to keep the codebase clean and split things by features so it's easy to manage.

*What packages did you choose and why?*

Used flutter_bloc for state, Hive for saving data, and freezed to avoid boilerplate code.

*What architectural decisions did you make?*

Broke things up into UI, logic (blocs/repos), and storage to keep stuff separate.

*What tradeoffs did you face?*

Picked Hive for speed and easy setup, even though it's more basic, and used code generation for less typing.
